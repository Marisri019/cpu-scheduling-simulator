# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a simple CPU scheduling simulator created to understand
how basic scheduling algorithms work in Operating Systems.

I built this project while studying OS concepts in my second year of
Computer Science Engineering to convert theory into practical
implementation.

---

## What this project does

- Allows the user to enter process details (PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time)
- Simulates First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling
- Calculates Waiting Time and Turnaround Time for each process
- Displays the results in a table format

---

## Why I built this

While studying CPU scheduling in theory, it was difficult to clearly
visualize how waiting time and turnaround time are calculated.
This project helped me understand the step-by-step execution of the
FCFS algorithm.

---

## Concepts used

- CPU scheduling basics
- Process arrival and burst time handling
- Waiting Time (WT) and Turnaround Time (TAT) calculation
- Modular JavaScript programming

---

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

---

## How to run the project

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Enter process details and run the scheduler

No additional setup is required.

---

## Current implementation

- FCFS (First Come First Serve) scheduling algorithm

---

## Future improvements

- Add SJF and Round Robin scheduling
- Gantt chart visualization
- Average Waiting Time and Turnaround Time calculation
- Better input validation

---

## What I learned

- Translating OS theory into working code
- Writing clean and modular JavaScript
- Understanding scheduling logic deeply instead of memorizing formulas
